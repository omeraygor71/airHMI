# AirHMI Arduino Library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

AirHMI Arduino library provides an easy-to-use way to manipulate AirHMI serial
displays. Users can use the libarry freely, either in commerical projects or 
open-source prjects,  without any additional condiitons. 

For more information about the AirHMI display project, please visit 
https://www.airhmi.com/
This site provdies all the necessary technical documnets, quick start guide, 
tutorials, demos, as well as some useful resources.

# Download Source Code 

Latest version is unstable and a mass of change may be applied in a short time 
without any notification for users. Commonly, it is for developers of this 
library. 

**Release version is recommanded for you, unless you are one of developers of this 
library.**


## Latest(unstable)

You can also clone it via git:
	https://github.com/omeraygor71/airHMI.git


## Releases(stable)



All releases can be available from:


# Documentation

Offline Documentation's entry `doc/Documentation/index.html` shiped with source code
can be open in your browser such as Chrome, Firefox or any one you like. 

# Suppported Mainboards

**All boards, which has one or more hardware serial, can be supported.**

For example:

	Arduino Uno: A basic microcontroller-based development board with a wide user base.

	Arduino Mega: A development board with more digital input/output pins and memory.

	Arduino Nano: A compact form-factor microcontroller board often used in embedded projects.

	Arduino Leonardo: A board capable of direct communication with a computer via USB.

	Arduino Due: A board with a 32-bit ARM-based microcontroller.

	Arduino Mini: A small-sized microcontroller board.

	Arduino Yun: A board that combines Arduino and the Linux operating system.

	Arduino Pro Mini: A low-cost, small-sized microcontroller board.

	Arduino MKR Series: Designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

	Arduino Zero: A board with a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller.

	ESP8266 Series:

	ESP-01: One of the earliest and most basic ESP8266 modules.
	
	ESP-12E/ESP-12F: More advanced versions with more GPIO pins.
	
	NodeMCU: A development board based on the ESP-12 module, which makes it easier to use in projects.
	
	ESP32 Series:

	ESP32 DevKit V1: A common development board for the ESP32.
	
	NodeMCU-32S: An ESP32-based development board similar to NodeMCU for ESP8266.
	
	Wemos D1 Mini ESP32: A compact ESP32 development board.

# Configuration

In configuration file AirConfig.h, you can find two macros below:

  - dbSerial: Debug Serial (baudrate:9600), needed by beginners for debug your 
    AirHMI applications or sketches. If your complete your work, it will be a 
    wise choice to disable Debug Serial.

  - airSerial: AirHMI Serial, the bridge of AirHMI and your mainboard.

**Note:** the default configuration is for MEGA2560.

## Redirect dbSerial and airSerial

If you want to change the default serial to debug or communicate with AirHMI ,
you need to modify the line in configuration file:

	#define dbSerial Serial    ---> #define dbSerial Serialxxx
    #define airSerial Serial2  ---> #define airSeria Serialxxx

## Disable Debug Serial

If you want to disable the debug information,you need to modify the line in 
configuration file:

    #define DEBUG_SERIAL_ENABLE ---> //#define DEBUG_SERIAL_ENABLE

# UNO-like Mainboards

If your board has only one hardware serial, such as UNO, you should disable 
dbSerial and redirect airSerial to Serial(Refer to section:`Serial configuration`).
